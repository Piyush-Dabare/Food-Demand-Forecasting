# Food-Demand-Forecasting

## Problem Statement :- 
The client, a meal delivery company operating in multiple cities, faces challenges in accurately 
forecasting demand for meals across various fulfillment centers. Given the perishable nature of 
raw materials and the need for weekly replenishment, the company aims to optimize inventory levels
to avoid wastage and stockouts, which are critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and reducing
costs.
